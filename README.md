# CryptoCalculator
This application was created using Axios with React. It was created as a weekend project and will be updated over time. 

## ToDo List 
- [x] Create a basic application which calculates the cryptocurreny value with its current market price
- [ ] Display the calculated value compared to its All-Time High (ATH) 
- [ ] Display additional crypto information based on the coin selected (current price, market cap, 24h price change…)
- [ ] Create toggle for light/dark modes
- [ ] Make app responsive
